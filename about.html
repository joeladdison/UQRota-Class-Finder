      <p>Need to find an empty room to study in? Or are you just curious about what's being taught next to you? There are quite a few reasons to use this site, I'm sure you'll have your own. Just enter a building and room, and we'll take care of the rest.</p>

      <p>The application uses the UQRota APIs to pull down near-live information from Si-Net. Thanks to Alex Wilson for creating and updating UQRota.</p>

      <p>Based on the <a href="https://github.com/emilevictor/What-s-In-There">What's In There</a> app written by Emile Victor, with help from Michael Mallon.</p>
